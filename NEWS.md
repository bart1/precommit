# precommit v0.1.3.9114-* (Development)

This version marks the switch to `language: r` of all existing hooks. This 
includes switching to R based hook for `readme-rmd-render`, avoiding the 
{usethis} dependency, integration tests via GitHub Actions, auto-updates for 
used packages, roxygen snippet generation and more. In addition:

* `use_precommit()` gains a `ci` argument, defaulting to `"native"`, which will
  guide the user to set up continuous integration of the hooks with either 
  [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci) or 
  [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). New exported 
  function `use_ci(ci = "native")` can be used to migrate existing repos. The
  default behavior for `ci` is governed by the R option `precommit.ci`.
* New option `precommit.block_install_hooks` (defaults to `FALSE`) governs
 if `use_precommit(..., install_hooks = TRUE)` should be blocking until 
 hooks are installed or not.
* Always sort `inst/WORDLIST` (#303).
* rename default branch to *main* (#307).
* `style-files` hook gains an argument `--cache-root` that is passed to 
  `options(styler.cache_root = ...)` (#305).
* Use dev version of {lintr} to reduce total dependencies from 71 to 59 that
  brings down install time.

# precommit v0.1.3.9012

This is a pre-release for `v0.2.0` and imposes a minimal version requirement 
on the [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) (`v2.13.0`). Please see
*Installation/Update* below for how to satisfy it. This will ensure future 
releases of {precommit} building on the newly supported 
[`language: r`](https://pre-commit.com/#r) will work out of the box instead of 
issuing messages that are confusing for most end-users. We aspire the transition
to `language: r` due to the following benefits: No more manual dependency management
for hooks nor conflicts with your global R library plus eventually it will 
enable the easy use of continuous integration services (enforcing hooks and 
auto-fixing problems with pre-commit.ci, GitHub Actions).


**Installation/Update**

Please follow the 
[update instructions](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/dev/#update) or
[installation instructions](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/dev/#installation)
depending on whether or not you previously used pre-commit.

**API changes**

- `version_precommit()` and `update_precommit()` are new functions to check the
  version of the installed pre-commit executable and to update it (#197).
- `style-files` hook now supports the full
  [`style_file()`](https://styler.r-lib.org/dev/reference/style_file.html) API,
  e.g. you can supply `--scope=spaces` and similar via `args:` in your
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. See the
  [docs](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/articles/available-hooks.html#style-files-1)
  for details.

**Major Changes**

- {precommit} now uses [`language: r`](https://pre-commit.com/#r) instead of 
  `language: script` from the [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com). 
  This requires `pre-commit >= 2.11.1` (ideally even `>= 2.13.0`). All hooks and 
  dependencies are now contained in a virtual environment with
  [`{renv}`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/). Thanks to {renv}'s excellent 
  [caching](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#cache-1), this 
  hardly consumes any space and is fast. This makes output
  of hooks more consistent across different local setups, make manual dependency
  management redundant and will facilitate running R hooks as part of CI/CD in
  the future, e.g. via https://pre-commit.ci or 
  [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/pre-commit/action) along with hook 
  implemented in other languages (#233, #250, #260, #264, #273).
- Because hooks run in a virtual environment and the `roxygenize` hook runs
  `pkgload::load_all()`, you need to list all dependencies of your package in
  `additional_dependencies` field in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. You will be 
  prompted to add them if they are missing, 
  `precommit::snippet_generate("additional-deps-roxygenize")` generates
  the code you can copy/paste (#247, #248, #249).
- Warnings are no longer promoted to errors in the styler hook, which is 
  particularly relevant for the apparently random error 
  `Unknown or uninitialised column: text` (#268).
- `deps-in-desc` now checks `.Rprofile`, `.Rmd` and `.Rnw` files in addition to 
  `.R` files (#216).  
- `style-files` and `roxygenize` hooks now warn if there is no permanent 
  `{R.cache}` cache set up. You can silence the warning with the hook argument 
  `--no-warn-cache` (#225).
- the lintr and styler hook now also check `.Rmd`, `.Rnw` and `.Rprofile` files 
  (#286).
  
**Minor changes**

- In order to avoid multiple installations of the pre-commit framework, a 
  warning is issued if multiple are found so the user can remove them (#266, 
  #273, #277, #278).
- The cache for the roxygen2 hook is now also invalidated for changes in formals 
  if there are no changes in roxygen comments (#214).
- `{renv}` infra files are not checked anymore by default in the template config
  files (#237).
- `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.pdf` and files in `.github/workflows` are no longer 
  spell-checked in the template config file (#276).
- All sub-patterns in the `exclude:` pattern of the spell check hook are now 
  ordered alphabetically (#276).
- The location of the pre-commit executable is now also recognized on Apple 
  Silicon when installed with Homebrew (#240).
- The `deps-in-desc` hook now points to the hook argument 
  `--allow_private_imports` when the hook fails due to private imports (#254).
- roxygenize hook is now fully tested (#267).
- Hook scripts were relocated and R hooks now have a file extension (#280).
- Hook dependency updates are proposed by an automatic monthly pull request 
  to `lorenzwalthert/precommit`. This does not affect users directly (#430).
- Updated GitHub Action workflows (#288).

# precommit v0.1.3

This is mainly a CRAN maintenance release because of #201 and includes some 
bug fixes and no API changes.

A big hand to all the contributors of this release:
[&#x0040;fschoner](https://github.com/fschoner), [&#x0040;krzyslom](https://github.com/krzyslom),

**Minor Changes**

- install_hooks in `use_precommit()` should now work as expected (#185).
- Switching from Travis to GitHub Actions (#191).
- `use_precommit()` now writes to the right `.Rbuildignore` when `root` is not 
  the current working directory (#188, @krzyslom).
- Documentation improvements (#179, @maurolepore)
- `precommit::uninstall_precommit()` now correctly removes 
  `^\\.pre-commit-config.yaml$`from `.Rbuildignore` and does not show a 
  prompt (#199).

# precommit v0.1.2

Initial CRAN release. See https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/.

# precommit v0.0.0.9049 

- Roxygen hook cache only includes files that are part of the index and 
  will hence be able to use the cache in cases it was previously invalidated 
  without need (#171).
- styler hook should fail if styling any file fails (#174).


# precommit v0.0.0.9048

- Don't allow legacy hooks by default, delete README hook from usethis 
  informatively (#167).

# precommit v0.0.0.9046

**Major Changes**

- `use_precommit()` gains new `install_hooks = TRUE` parameter. Now all hook
  environments defined in yaml config are by default installed in advance.
  (#163)

# precommit v0.0.0.9044

**Breaking Changes**

- `uninstall_precommit()`'s `scope` argument value `"global"` was renamed to 
  `"user"`.

**Major Changes**

- By default, the spell check hook now exposes a regex pattern in the default
  `.pre-commit-config-config.yaml` for the spell check hook for easy 
  manipulation. Also, additional patterns were excluded such as `.sh` (#157).

**Minor Changes**

- `DESCRIPTION` now links the pkgdown website in addition to the GitHub repo (#155).
- `.Renviron`, `.Rrofile`, `.RData`, `.feather` and `.Rds` is now also excluded
  from the spell checking hook.


# precommit v0.0.0.9042

**Breaking Changes**

A major API review was conducted to make the package ready for a CRAN 
submission in #152:

- all functions have the argument `path_root` renamed to `root`.
- argument `root` now always defaults to `here::here()` for consistency.
- argument `config_source` was renamed to `config_source` in 
  `use_precommit_config()` and `use_precommit()`.
- `use_precommit_config`'s argument `force` gains a default value for 
  consistency with `use_config()`.
- `use_precommit_config`'s argument `verbose` now is in the same position as
  in `use_config()`.

Additional breaking changes are:

- use env `r-precommit` instead of `r-reticulate` to avoid conflicts with other 
  packages commonly installed in `r-reticulate` (#147).
- the hook `spell-check` does no longer take the hook argument `ignore-files` 
  since this was inconsistent with the pre-commit framework. To exclude 
  additional files, specify the `exclude:` key in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  file. If you like to keep excluding the default files, make sure you include 
  the [default regex](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/articles/available-hooks.html#spell-check)
  (#153).

# precommit v0.0.0.9040

- roxygenize hook now only ran when `git diff --cached` contains roxygen 
  comments (#151).
- conda is a suggested dependency now, so those who choose a different 
  installation method have a more lightweight dependency graph (#136).
- Use more thoughtful order for hooks, between pkg and project (#142).

# precommit v0.0.0.9031 up to v0.0.0.9038

Test release process.

# precommit v0.0.0.9030

- auto-detect pre-commit executable when installed via pip for Linux (#120), 
  macOS (#131).
- auto-detect pre-commit executable when installed via brew for macOS (#132).
- `use_precommit()` gains new argument `config_source` to copy an existing
  config file into the repo at initialization. The argument defaults to 
  `options('precommit.config_source')` to make it easy for users to use 
  their preferred hooks in every repo they initialize (#111).
- Create `r-precommit` env if not existent before installing into it (#114).
- Unify vignettes on available hooks and arguments (#109).
- Fail fast when repo is not a git repo (#111).
- default config file has spell-check activated (#118).
- also test on macOS (#120).
- template `.pre-commit-config.yaml` includes hook to check files have a EOF
  blank line (#126).
- spell-check hook now removes blank lines hand has no blank line at EOF (#127).
- depreciate `path_pre_commit_exec()` in favor of `path_precommit_exec()` 
  and adapt internals to replace `pre_commit` with `precommit` (#130).
- more coherent error catching for system calls (#135).
- internal refactoring (#136).

# precommit 0.0.0.9017

- **BREAKING:** If you used precommit < 0.0.0.9017 (and if you choose a 
  different installation strategy than `precommit::install_precommit()), you can link your existing 
  executable by setting the R option `precommit.executable` to the path where 
  you stored the pre-commit executable.
  
- Adding tools to work with hooks: ` install_precommit()`, `use_precommit()`,
  `uninstall_precommit()`, `open_config()` and `open_wordlist()` using conda 
  environments on all platforms.

- Make repo a fully R CMD CHECK compliant R package (includes moving hooks to
  `inst/bin` from `bin`.)

- renamed repo from pre-commit-hooks to precommit.

- added pkgdown website, restructured README.
