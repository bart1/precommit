# Setting up CI/CD

When initializing pre-commit in your repo with `precommit::use_precommit()`, 
you can specify the Continuous integration provider with `ci = "native"` if you 
want to use [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci) or `ci = "gha"` if you want 
to use GitHub Actions. For existing repos, see below.

# Comparison 

Next, we quickly introduce the two options:

## pre-commit.ci

**Pros:**

- by the creator of pre-commit. Certain CI settings in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  [are supported](https://pre-commit.ci).
- very fast.
- will at some point also be supported for repos hosted outside of GitHub.
- No maintenance effort for you.
- No additional file in the repo.

**Cons:**

- You need to authenticate the pre-commit.ci App in GitHub. 
- System dependencies are not supported. In particular, since {roxygen2} loads
  your package for the roxygenize hook, this hook will fail if your package has
  system dependencies that are not shipped with the package.
  
## GitHub Actions

**Pros:**

- more flexible in how you run `pre-commit`.
- No new authentication needed. 
- If your package has system dependencies and you want to use the roxygenize 
  hook, you can install them.
  
**Cons:**

- You need to maintain the workflow file, e.g. when GitHub changes the syntax, 
  you need to adapt.
- You'll have one additional file per provider (e.g. GitHub, Gitlab).


# Migrating existent repos

We provide helper functionality to set up CI/CD. Use `precommit::use_ci("gha")` 
for GitHub Actions or `precommit::use_ci("native")` for pre-commit.ci 
respectively.
